        Blizzard
        BY WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS

        Snow:
        years of anger following
        hours that float idly down —
        the blizzard
        drifts its weight
        deeper and deeper for three days
        or sixty years, eh? Then
        the sun! a clutter of
        yellow and blue flakes —
        Hairy looking trees stand out
        in long alleys
        over a wild solitude.
        The man turns and there —
        his solitary track stretched out
        upon the world.
