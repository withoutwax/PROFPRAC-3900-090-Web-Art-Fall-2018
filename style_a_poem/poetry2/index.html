        Banish Air from Air - (963)
        BY EMILY DICKINSON
        Banish Air from Air -
        Divide Light if you dare -
        They'll meet
        While Cubes in a Drop
        Or Pellets of Shape
        Fit -
        Films cannot annul
        Odors return whole
        Force Flame
        And with a Blonde push
        Over your impotence
        Flits Steam.
