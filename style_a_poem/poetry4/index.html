        DIRTY, POORLY DRESSED
        BY ROBERTO BOLAÑO
        On the dogs’ path, my soul came upon
        my heart. Shattered, but alive,
        dirty, poorly dressed, and filled with love.
        On the dogs’ path, there where no one wants to go.
        A path that only poets travel
        when they have nothing left to do.
        But I still had so many things to do!
        And nevertheless, there I was: sentencing myself to death
        by red ants and also
        by black ants, traveling through the empty villages:
        fear that grew
        until it touched the stars.
        A Chilean educated in Mexico can withstand everything,
        I thought, but it wasn’t true.
        At night, my heart cried. The river of being, chanted
        some feverish lips I later discovered to be my own,
        the river of being, the river of being, the ecstasy
        that folds itself into the bank of these abandoned villages.
        Mathematicians and theologians, diviners
        and bandits emerged
        like aquatic realities in the midst of a metallic reality.
        Only fever and poetry provoke visions.
        Only love and memory.
        Not these paths or these plains.
        Not these labyrinths.
        Until at last my soul came upon my heart.
        It was sick, it’s true, but it was alive.
